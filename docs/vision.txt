About Thumbnailer
#################

This document presents the vision of the ``Thumbnailer`` project, as shared by
:doc:`AUTHORS`.

****************
Why thumbnailer?
****************

Thumbnail generation is a feature often used on websites. As developers, we
**do not want**:

* to install and configure thumbnail-related modules, again and again, on every
  project we start.
* to use a different solution for every framework we use to build a website.
* to deal with deployment.
* thumbnail generation to downgrade our overall website performance.
* increase server's memory just to be able to perform operations on images.

Moreover, as internauts, we **do not want**:

* to manually edit images before we publish them.
* to install some image edition software just to create thumbnails.

That's why **we need a thumbnail generation service**.

Some :doc:`alternatives` exist, but ``Thumbnailer`` has the following valuable
features:

* Open-source. It can be used to create a hosted thumbnail service (saas), but
  you are also free to deploy it on your own infrastructure if you want.
* Extensible. Create, plug and configure :doc:`engines`, :doc:`writers` and
  :doc:`readers`.
* Full ecosystem. If you want to manage your own thumbnail generation service,
  ``Thumbnailer`` provides ready-to-use recipes, including thumbnail
  generation, serving, caching...
* Generate thumbnails out of almost any document. Input can be images, PDF
  files, HTML pages, ...

However, this version of is still a proof of concept: all features aren't
available yet.

******************
Development status
******************

``Thumbnailer`` is under active development. 

Currently, ``Thumbnailer`` project may contain parts of the ecosystem, so that
it forms a product. Later, this project may be limited to the glue between
ecosystem parts, these components being shipped as external projects.
