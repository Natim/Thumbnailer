``Thumbnailer`` is an ecosystem around thumbnails:

1. a thumbnail generation service, i.e. a web application providing an API;
2. tools to integrate the service in your favorite framework, i.e. template
   tag for Django;
3. various recipes to easily generate, host and serve thumbnails, i.e. server
   configuration samples and deployment scripts.
