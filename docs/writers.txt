The thumbnail generation service uses writers to return thumbnails.
Writers take result of :doc:`engines` as input, and:

* actually put thumbnail content somewhere, typically in an HTTP response, but
  could be on some storage.
* return response to client, i.e. inform client of success or failure of the
  request.

Available writers:

* default writer: gets a PIL.Image and returns a HTTP response.
